//You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.
//Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.
//A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

class Solution {
    public int appendCharacters(String s, String t) {
        int sLength = s.length();
        int tLength = t.length();

        int l = 0;
        int r = 0;

        while(l < sLength && r < tLength) {
            if(s.charAt(l) == t.charAt(r)) {
                l++;
                r++;
            } else {
                l++;
            }
        }

        return tLength - r;
